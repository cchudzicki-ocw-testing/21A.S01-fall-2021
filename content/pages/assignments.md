## Reading Responses

You will turn in a 200-word response to the assigned readings/films for each session. These responses are meant to help you synthesize and integrate the readings for your own learning (and give you a starting point for in-class discussion!), and also to help me gauge your understanding of the readings, what they brought up for you, etc., so that I might pitch classes at the right level. To that end, your responses should engage critically with the assigned materials: summarize the questions they raise and their key arguments, and lay out how the pieces relate to one another; state what remains unclear to you or leaves you perplexed, what questions the texts brought up for you, etc.Â 

Of 18 possible reading responses, you must turn in 15 over the course of the semester. You will be graded on both the total number of responses and on their content. The responses will count for 20% of your final grade.
